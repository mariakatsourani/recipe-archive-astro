Heat the oil in a medium saucepan on a medium-high flame, then fry the onion for eight minutes, stirring often, until soft and caramelised. Add the curry powder, chilli flakes, garlic and ginger, and fry for two minutes more, stirring continuously. Add the lentils, stir through for a minute, then add the tomatoes, turmeric powder, parsley stalks, 600ml cold water, a teaspoon of salt and a very generous grind of pepper, and leave to heat through.

Pour the coconut milk into a bowl and gently whisk until smooth and creamy. Set aside four tablespoons – you’ll use this when serving – then tip the remaining coconut milk into the soup pot. Bring the mixture up to a boil, turn down the heat to medium and leave to simmer gently for 25 minutes, until the lentils are soft but still hold their shape.

Divide the soup between four warmed bowls, drizzle over the remaining coconut milk, scatter the parsley leaves on top and serve with lime wedges for squeezing over.
