Slice the bananas thinly (ca 1cm).

Place bananas in a medium bowl and mix gently with the sugar. Let sit for 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 200Â°.

Grease a 15 cm wide pan.

In another large bowl, whisk the eggs until smooth. Add condensed milk and butter and beat until well combined.

Stir in the flour, vanilla, and salt until fully mixed.

Gently fold in the sweetened bananas until well-distributed through the batter.

Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan.

Bake the cake for about 40 minutes until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
