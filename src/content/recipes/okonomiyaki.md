To make the sauce

Massage the cabbage with some salt, to soften it.

Whisk the flour, baking powder, eggs and dashi in a large mixing bowl.

Add the cabbage, corn, shrimp and spring onions and mix to combine.

Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the batter and shape into a thick round pancake. Cook for 6 minutes on each side with a lid on. Flip and cook for another 4-6 minutes.

Drizzle with the tonkatsu sauce and the mayo and sprinkle with spring onions and bonito or nori.
