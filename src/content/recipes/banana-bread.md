Preheat oven to 180°.

Coat loaf pan with butter.

Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl.

Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat brown sugar, mascarpone, and butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes.

Add eggs one at a time, beating to blend after each addition.

Reduce speed to low, add flour mixture, and mix until just combined.

Add bananas and mix just until combined.

Fold in chocolate and/or walnuts, if using. Scrape batter into prepared pan.

Bake bread for 60–65 minutes.
