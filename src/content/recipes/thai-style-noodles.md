Boil noodles. When cooked toss with sesame oil.

Add oil to a pan and fry the cabbage over high heat until just starting to char. Then add 1/2 tsp of sugar and the 1/2 tbsp of soy sauce. Stir-fry for another minute or until the cabbage is nicely coloured.

Add the garlic and stir-fry for 20 seconds. Then add the chilli powder. Put aside.
