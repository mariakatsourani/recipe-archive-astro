Roast the sesame seeds on medium heat for 5-7 minutes.

Process the sesame seeds, sugar and salt until the mixture forms a mass around the blade, about 3 minutes. Some fat will be released but the mixutre will not be pasty.

Add the flour and pulse until incorporated with the seeds into a sandy mixture.

Add the butter and vanilla, and pulse until the mixture forms a mass around the blade.

Transfer to a sheet of plastic wrap and firmly squeeze, and roll into a 2-inch-diameter log. Refrigerate until firm, at least 1½ hours or up to 3 days.

Cut the chilled log into 1 cm thick slices and place on baking sheet.

Bake at 180° for 18-20 minutes.
