Beat the egg in a large bowl. Add the cheese, flour, sugar,vanilla, and a dash of salt.

Mix thoroughly until the ingredients are well mixed and the batter holds together in a loose lump, similar to thick pancake batter.

Fry in a tablespoon of oil over medium high heat until golden (roughly 2 minutes on each side).
