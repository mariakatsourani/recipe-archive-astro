(Put a couple of tablespoons of ash wrapped in a pouch inside the juice. Cook it on a slow boil while removing any foam formed on the suface. It takes about 2 hours to reduce it to 3/4 of the original volume. Let it sit overnight an drain carefully.)

Heat up the grape juice just a little.
Add the four in banches in a food processor and pulse until well blended. Not lumps should be present.
Put the mixture in a pot and heat genlty until thickened. Be carefoul, because the bottom can easily burn.
When the mixture is quite thick but stirrable pour in on a big pan and let it harden or eat it fresh. The thickness should be about 1,5cm.
Sprinkle the seasame seeds on top while still warm.
When hard and managable cut in into pieces and store outside the fridge, using parchment paper to make sure nothing sticks together.

The jelly can be stored for up to 6 months. The sugar might cristalise on the outside.
