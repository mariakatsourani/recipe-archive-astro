Juice 1 whole lemon to get 3 tablespoons juice and set aside. Cut the remaining 1/2 lemon into 3 to 4 thin slices.

Heat the broiler and line a sheet pan with foil.

In a bowl, add the lemon slices, scallions and 1 tbsp olive oil.

Place on sheet pan and broil until blackened, tossing occasionally, 7 to 9 minutes for the scallions and about another 5 minutes for the lemon slices.

In a food processor, add the feta, cream cheese, remaining olive oil, reserved lemon juice, black pepper, cayenne and hot water. Pur√©e until very smooth, then add the scallions.
