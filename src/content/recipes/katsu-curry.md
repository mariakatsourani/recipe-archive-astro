To make the curry sauce, heat 1 tbsp oil in a pan, cook the onions and chopped carrots until the onions are soft about 8 mins.

Add the garlic and ginger and sizzle for another 30 secs, then stir in the curry powder and turmeric.

Add the coconut milk, maple syrup or honey and 100ml water. Cover and simmer over a low heat for 20 mins.

Blitz the sauce using a blender.

For the tofu, mix the cornflour with 4 tbsp water and some seasoning.

Dip the tofu into the flour mixture. Place the breadcrumbs in another bowl and dip it, turning until well coated.

Heat the oil in a frying pan and the tofu for 4-5 mins on each side until golden.
